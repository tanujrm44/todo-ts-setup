# Drag-and-Drop To-Do App with TypeScript  

A simple **To-Do App** built with **TypeScript** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. This project demonstrates the implementation of core TypeScript concepts such as **classes**, **interfaces**, **generics**, and more, while adding a drag-and-drop feature for an enhanced user experience.  

## Prerequisites  
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)  
- A code editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))  

## Getting Started  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/tanujrm44/todo-ts-setup.git  
   cd todo-ts-setup
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Although this project primarily uses TypeScript, you may want to install TypeScript globally:
   ```bash  
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

## Project Structure
   ```
   todo-ts-setup/  
   â”œâ”€â”€ src/  
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app.ts           # Main entry point  
   â”œâ”€â”€ dist/                # Compiled JavaScript files  
   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html           # Main HTML file  
   â”œâ”€â”€ app.css              # Styling for the app  
   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json         # Dependencies for the app
   â”œâ”€â”€ app.css              # Styling for the app  
   â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration file
   ```

This project is inspired by the need to learn and practice TypeScript in a real-world application.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
